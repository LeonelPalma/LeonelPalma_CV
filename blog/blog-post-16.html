                                            <p>It is always a great time to get started learning coding. Having the ability to code means that you can deliver impactful solutions to businesses and individuals who need them.</p>
                                            <p>Choosing the best programming language to learn depends a lot on what you are wanting to develop, since each project will have different needs that the language should meet.</p>
                                            <p>What is the most popular programming language? A new report reveals that <u>Python continues to stand out among developers' preferences, however, SQL is gaining popularity</u>.</p>
                                            <p>In the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022" target="_blank" title=""> ranking prepared by IEEE</a> it is possible to find programming languages such as C, and variants such as C++ and C#, in the first places, followed by others such as Java and Javascript.</p>
