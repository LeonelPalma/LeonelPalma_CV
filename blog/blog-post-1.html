                                            <p><b>1) Rich Dad Poor Dad (Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter)</b></p>
                                            <p>
                                                This was the first book to speak clearly about financial independence and show you the way to go from being an employee to being an investor.
                                                First published in 1997 in the United States, the book became an immediate best seller and today enjoys the status of a classic in financial education literature.
                                                The authors use parables based on Kiyosaki's life to indicate efficient ways to build heritage. The work generated a series of other products, such as publications and games aimed at children and adolescents.

                                            <p><b>2) Secrets of the Millionaire Mind (T. Harv Eker)</b></p>
                                            <p>
                                                After talking about one of the greatest classics about financial education, I present one of the greatest classics about personal development mindset.
                                                This book makes comparisons between a poverty-oriented mind and a wealth-oriented mind, presenting the main mindset shifts you need to put in place if you want to think like a rich person.
                                                Eker tells how he managed to overcome personal difficulties and become a millionaire in two and a half years. Eker's method involves 17 basic principles that should guide a person towards the accumulation of wealth.

                                            <p><b>3) Work 4 Hours a Week (Timothy Ferriss)</b></p>
                                            <p>
                                                This book is one of the greatest classics of digital entrepreneurship and, without a doubt, is the greatest inspiration to quit a job and dedicate exclusively to digital business.
                                                In this book, you will learn about a new concept of work, retirement and lifestyle.
                                                The work is a true manual for entrepreneurs with a focus on high productivity. Ferris seeks to clarify the relationship between time and money, bringing important reflections.
                                                The proposal is to forget the old concept of work and not wait for retirement to enjoy life. Whether your dream is to escape the rut, experience great world travel, earn a five-figure monthly income, or just live longer and work less, “Work 4 Hours a Week” is the book for you.

                                            <p>
                                                This book is one of the greatest classics (perhaps even the greatest) in the stock market investing literature and has been cited as the greatest investment book in history by none other than Warren Buffett (the greatest investor in the world).
                                                In this book, you will learn fundamental concepts about how to invest in the stock market and how to build your investment portfolio. To illustrate these concepts, the author uses reports of historical events, that is, real examples that help investors understand the topic.

                                            <p>
                                                It is one of the greatest classics on leadership and personal development. In this book, you will learn a new philosophy of leadership, self-motivation and personal success.
                                                The author spent 20 years investigating the methods and practices of 500 of the world's richest men in the early decades of the 20th century. From this research, the author extracted 15 characteristics common to all those who amassed a fortune.
                                                Other of my great suggestions, by the same author, are “The Law of Success” and “Outwitting the Devil”.

                                            <p>
                                                Written by award-winning and renowned economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, this book addresses the pitfalls of the financial market and shows how they are used to exploit psychological weaknesses and consumer ignorance.
                                                Among the topics discussed are: the way in which the credit card is used, often without limits; and the seductive tactics of advertising campaigns, which make us pay dearly for the acquisition of some goods.
                                                The book also includes stories of characters who knew how to deal with these manipulations by seeking more knowledge, demonstrating tactics on how to escape these consumption traps. This work is essential for controlling expenses and purchases, because once you start to recognize the pitfalls, you start to fall into them less.

The wisdom conveyed by the book is based on the successful practices of the ancient Babylonians, which despite being ancient are still very useful today.
                                                The book offers advice for anyone who wants to learn how to: not waste resources during times of opulence; seek knowledge and information rather than just profit; secure an income for the future; maintain punctual payment of debts and, above all, cultivate one's skills, becoming more and more skillful and aware.
