                                            <p>Focused on productivity, finance or other goals, these books often propose the change of mentality through tools such as neurolinguistics, repetition and the power of the unconscious.</p>

                                            <p>According to Dale Carnegie writer, artist and philosopher, "even in technical lines like engineering, about 15% of financial success is due to technical knowledge and about 85% is due to human engineering skill, personality and ability to lead people.".</p>
                                            <p>To paraphrase Carl Sagan writer, cosmologist and biologist, "no knowledge, however varied, is wasted. The question is how you collect, judge, handle and, above all, where and how you apply that knowledge.".</p>

                                                <li><b>Power Without Limits (by Anthony Robbins)</b></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Anthony Robbins relied on the concepts of neurolinguistic programming â NLP â to present strategies aimed at achieving the objectives outlined.
                                                    The book, which has made NLP popular around the world, is one of those you can't stop reading.
                                                    With a practical and direct language, the author uses several diagrams, examples and success stories to demonstrate how NLP techniques should be applied in personal life.
                                                    It is a fascinating guide, consecrated as the gateway of several professionals, such as entrepreneurs and coaches, in the universe of neurolinguistic programming.
                                                    The author's proposal is the creation of a correct mindset to achieve objectives, through tools fundamental to self-knowledge.

                                                <p>
                                                    The book by internationally renowned psychologist Carol Dweck talks about how our mental attitude (or mindset) directly influences what happens to us.
                                                    The work explains that there are two types of mindset and they are the ones that differentiate people. This is because this characteristic defines how each interprets and reacts to different situations.
                                                    In addition to presenting the types of attitude metals, the book also gives precious tips to modify what does not please you and does not contribute to your personal satisfaction.

                                                <p>
                                                    Written by neurolinguistics expert Anthony Robbins, Awaken Your Inner Giant reveals how decision-making happens and how we can work them to achieve our goals.
                                                    According to the author, we all have the ability to change in an instant what we want in our life, because we develop unique characteristics when we focus on the improvement of an area.
                                                    Through case studies, self-help tests, and a program developed especially for the reader, Robbins teaches them how to break patterns of behavior and thus make major personal changes.

                                                <p>
                                                    Personal development and emotions are closely related.
                                                    That is, the ability to deal with emotional aspects is an essential condition to improve as a person.
                                                    This ability can be called emotional intelligence and has, in this book by Daniel Goleman, a great ally.
                                                    The author is a psychologist and has become highly internationally recognized for his work.
                                                    In the book, he helps the reader understand his temperament and his emotional reactions. From this, it also teaches to control and modify important aspects.

                                                <li><b>Discover Your Strengths (by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton)</b></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Do you have difficulty realizing what your qualities are?
                                                    This is a very common problem.
                                                    After all, we are more accustomed to identifying negative aspects that need to be improvedâwhether in personal or professional life.
                                                    This is the criticism made by researchers Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton in their book. According to them, companies focus heavily on employee weaknesses rather than recognizing and working on their strengths.
                                                    In counterpoint, the authors believe that successful people are those who focus on further improving their core skills.
                                                    Therefore, they produced this book to teach the reader how to discover and enhance their talents.
