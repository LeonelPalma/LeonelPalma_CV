Review the following skills to see where you might want to focus your attention for your ongoing development:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong><u>Resilience and adoptability</u></strong></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    The number one power skill, resilience, is defined as the ability to demonstrate problem solving, emotional control, optimism, and self-efficacy. Resilience can be learned, reinforced, and spread through an organization.
                                                    This is particularly relevant when considering that change is constant and fundamental to ANY organisation that wishes to survive and thrive. People who can adapt to changing circumstances and environments, being resourceful and enterprising to embrace new ideas will always be in demand.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Digital fluency is the aptitude to effectively and ethically interpret information, discover meaning, design content, construct knowledge, and communicate ideas in a digitally connected world.</p>

                                                - Digital capability – being digitally adept and innovative; able to confidently choose and use digital tools to learn, create, and share.
                                                <br />
                                                - Digital principles – demonstrating values when working digitally, including being ethical, respectful, and responsible.
                                                <br />
                                                - Digital literacy – being discerning and critical, able to locate, understand, organise, evaluate, and adapt digital content.

                                                <p>
                                                    Offshore teams are now a well-established norm for many organisations. If a company operations work across multiple countries or in other locations within your country, the ability to connect and engage with people from different ethnicities and cultures will be an important skill.
                                                    The ability to build links and collaborate with people you may never share a meeting room with will still be an essential underpinning skill.

                                                    Otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ, involves recognizing various aspects of your feelings and emotions and taking the time to work on the elements of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
                                                    Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

                                                    With few exceptions, work is all about engaging and working with others. The ability to communicate well so that you fully understand what people are communicating to you and in turn, what you are seeking to communicate to them, is a crucial skill.
                                                    Collaboration is open sharing of information, where elements such as diversity, understanding differences, adaptability and behavioural flexibility all play a part. When everyone is on the same page in terms of purpose and process, productivity can get a real boost.
                                                    The quality of your collaboration can be particularly essential when working across functions, where your work objectives rely on the support and performance of others who do not directly work in your area of expertise. Here trust and transparency play a key role in the success of such relationships.

                                                <p>
                                                    Leading people through change is important to ease worries, encourage communication and address uncertainty. Periods of change can be stressful for an organization, but strong, empathetic leadership can help businesses successfully move through these transitions. Leaders may not be aware that they have a choice to either spread positivity or negativity during a change process. Change generally represents a challenging time for employees and knowing how to lead people in a way that fosters a hopeful view of change rather than an anxious one will make all the difference to change acceptance.
                                                    Change management uses a structured process and set of tools to lead people towards a desired outcome. Ultimately, skilled change management effectively engages people to ready and support their adoption of a new way of working.

                                                <p>
                                                    Few people enjoy working in a constantly, highly pressurized environment. The post-pandemic hybrid working culture that is becoming the new normal means that many people will no longer tolerate continuous stress-inducing working conditions. Employees are now more mobile and could be motivated to find a more enlightened employer who monitors and responds to excessive stresses in the workplace.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    There are many <u>benefits to managing workplace stress</u> well. Stress unto itself is not so much the problem, it’s the degree and enduring nature of stress which needs to be controlled. A company that has the right balance can see:<br />
                                                    - Fewer people off sick<br />
                                                    - Attracting and retaining the best people<br />
                                                    - Move effective team functioning<br />
                                                    - Being known as an employer who cares

                                                    It is useful to understand that time is not what can be managed – it’s what we do with the time that really matters. Even the most successful people still only have 24 hours in the day.
                                                    One of the best time management strategies is to allocate your tasks in the categories of urgent versus important. High urgency, high importance task should be the ones that get done first, followed closely by less urgent but still important tasks.
                                                    There is a myriad of time management tools and techniques freely available off the internet – all it takes is a brief search to find them. Studying some basic time management strategies can rapidly make a difference to one’s ability to getting things done – the key driving purpose behind using time well.
