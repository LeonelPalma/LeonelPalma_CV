                                                	Where do you want to be in five years and what have you done to achieve your goals?<br />
                                                	Are you sure you are walking to realize your dream at the moment you are living now?<br />
                                                	Do you have any idea what your motivation is and what you want to achieve by the end of today?
                                            </p>
                                            </p>
                                            <br /><hr />
                                            <p>
                                                The truth is that if you want to succeed, you need to set goals. No goals, lack of focus and direction.
                                                Setting goals not only allows you to take control of the direction of your life, but it also provides a reference that helps you determine if you are really close to success.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>You can't just say "I want this to happen" and wait sitting down for a miracle to fall from the sky.</p>
                                            <p>Setting goals is a process that begins with careful consideration of what you want to achieve and ends with a lot of hard work to actually do that.</p>
                                            <p>In between, there are some very well-defined steps that transcend the specifics of each goal and knowing them will allow you to set goals that you can accomplish.</p>
                                            <hr /><br />
                                            <p>
                                                <b>TIP 1: Your goals need to be, above all, motivating and realistic!</b><br />
                                                <u>When you set goals to achieve your goals, it's important that they motivate you</u><br />
                                                This means that you need to make sure that they are important to you and that there is value in achieving them, because if you have little interest in the outcome, or if they are irrelevant in a broader context, the chances of you working for them to happen are minimal.<br />
                                                <u>Motivation is the key to achieving goals</u><br />
                                                Also, set goals that relate to the high priorities of your life, but that are in line with the energy you can give off. Without this kind of care, you can end up with many goals, but few results.
                                                So if meeting a goal requires commitment – and that's a fact! – and you don't feel motivated, you can't keep it, you're sure to give up what you need to do.
                                                This, in turn, leaves you disappointed and frustrated with yourself, which is demotivating and can end up triggering a destructive state of mind – don't let that happen!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>TIP 2: Set dates!</b><br />
                                                Setting dating helps you scale what really works and what doesn't, which helps you measure where you're on your way to achieving your goals and achieving success.
                                                If your goal is simply set to "reduce expenses," how will you know when you were successful?
                                                If in a month you have a reduction of 1% or 10% in two years, what will that tell you? After all, it was a setback in his spending, but was that enough for the period in question? You won't be able to tell if you don't set dates for your goals.
                                                Make this image clear in your mind – the "you" in X days, weeks or months – so that when you reach your goals, you'll be aware of it.
                                                Without a way to measure your success, you lose the celebration that comes with knowing that you've really achieved something, and it can slow you into achieving your goals.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>TIP 3: No waiting for things to happen – you need to be proactive!</b><br />
                                                To achieve the goals of your life, it is not enough to dream that they happen "one day" and never get up and go after.
                                                You need to understand that this approach needs to change if you want things to happen or they will never happen.
                                                You may find yourself lucky, but I guarantee no one will come to you on a white horse with your dreams all fulfilled in hand and deliver you – you're the one who has to chase after them.
                                                For this, you need to stop procrastinating for four hours in a row on social networks, wishing to have that job, that lifestyle, that social life... and instead go out and be proactive.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>TIP 4: You attract what you say, so say goodbye to negativity!</b><br />
                                                Some people believe in karma, others believe that we plant what we collect... Regardless of the belief team you're a part of, our attitude toward life determines life's attitude toward us.
                                                If you project negativity to the world, make sure it comes straight to you.
                                                Every time you tell yourself you can't do that or can't do that, you really condition yourself not to be able to do anything.
                                                As cliché as it sounds, having a "I can do" attitude, even if it's not spontaneous at first, can really help you accomplish your goals.
                                                Whenever the doubt about your abilities begins to arise in your mind, push it away and be the kind of person who has half a full glass instead of a half-empty glass.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>TIP 5: Don't let the failures stop you!</b><br />
                                                Setting goals rarely happens without problems, so it will be up to you to deal with them.
                                                You'll encounter obstacles that will make you question why you tried in the first place, but that's part of the issue, and the sooner you accept it, the better.
                                                Instead of letting failure bring you down, acknowledge that it happened and learn from it.
                                                Write down what worked well and what didn't and move on – that's what will make you a stronger, resilient, and determined goal setr.
