                                            <p>As a species, humans are inherently lazy. In any situation, we are programmed to find the most practical way to save energy expenditures.</p>
                                            <p>That's why, when choosing between running and watching TV, many of us choose the latter. It's simply our nature.</p>
                                            <p>This also explains why it can be so difficult to motivate us at work, where we almost always find ways to procrastinate until we run out of time, especially when it involves performing monotonous or tedious tasks, such as answering emails, filling out spreadsheets, or planning presentations.</p>
                                            <p>The problem, of course, is that motivating yourself for effective and persistent performance at work is the key to your ultimate success.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                Motivation has to do with our choices, where we spend energy and what we prioritize, being especially relevant in the world of work.
                                                Being highly motivated at work means we strive harder to do our best.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Sometimes we are motivated by external factors such as how well we are being paid, the benefits we receive through work, or whether we receive positive recognition or feedback from a supervisor.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Other times, internal factors motivate us, such as how much we like what we do or the importance we believe work has – whether for the company or for the world.

                                            <h4><b>What is the importance of motivation at work?</b></h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Motivation at work has a direct impact on our performance. Therefore, given the benefits of having a highly motivated workforce, it is in the company's interest to maximize employee engagement and motivation.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b><u>Improving motivation in the workplace has a number of benefits:</u></b>
                                            <p>
                                                <u>Increased Performance</u><br />
                                                A motivated employee will do their best and work harder, which will make them generally perform at higher levels and will certainly work harder.
                                                Of course we are not talking about overloading the employee, but the truth is that when someone is unmotivated, we can differentiate between their maximum performance and their typical performance.
                                                However, when the individual is motivated, there is little difference between the two – this means that they act regularly to the best of their abilities.
                                                If the company does not want a job poorly performed by a poorly motivated employee, it needs to work increasing motivation.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <u>Increased Employee Engagement</u><br />
                                                Higher levels of motivation often translate into employees more involved with their team and their work.
                                                This means that a company that invests in increasing employee engagement therefore has healthier relationships between co-workers, better customer service and increased creativity, innovation and problem solving, as motivated employees exhibit higher levels of creativity, innovation and are better at problem solving.
                                                Because they work with more passion and feel connected to the work they are doing, they put more energy into these activities.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <u>Increased Job Satisfaction</u><br />
                                                Employees with higher levels of motivation also report higher levels of job satisfaction.
                                                Because of this, they are more efficient, have higher levels of productivity and care more about what they are doing, putting more energy and attention into the tasks they need to perform.
                                                Faced with the challenges, motivated employees take on new behaviors and are creative and flexible in the search for alternative solutions. As a result, they are able to overcome the inconveniences that arise in the middle of the route.
                                                Therefore, ensuring greater job satisfaction – whether increasing wages, promoting or switching it to a sector where it does better – will ensure more motivation.
                                            </p>

                                                <u>Increased Employee Well-Being</u><br />
                                                Motivated employees report higher states of well-being and better mental preparation.
                                                When they are energized and enthusiastic to do their job, their physical and mental health improves.
                                                In fact, this relationship becomes cyclical; greater motivation leads to a greater sense of well-being. At the same time, improving employee well-being leads to higher levels of motivation.

                                            <ol>
                                                <li><u>Remember why you're doing your job</u></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Most of us are compelled to work hard every day, not for short-term goals, but for general imperatives.
                                                    Still, almost all people have a centralizing inspiration in their lives – an inspiration that is present in their mind drives them to work hard.
                                                    You, for example, can be driven by the dream of being paid to practice the craft you love – writing, coding, photographing, teaching, etc. – developing the feeling of becoming better and better at something you like to do; you can feel motivated by the idea of getting money to make a dream come true – buying a house, a car or taking a trip – or you can stay focused on the name of your family that depends on you.
                                                    Whatever it is, the first step is to identify what motivates you more significantly, because that's your fuel.

                                                <li><u>Turn a big goal into smaller goals</u></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    More tangibly, what breaks the will of many people is the feeling of being overwhelmed with the task at hand – looking at a new project and thinking, "I will never be able to do that."
                                                    We can fight this trend by dividing that big project into smaller goals. After you do this, you can gait the process of completing each minor step.
                                                    Personally, I think the achievement of every small goal in a big project is to reach the next "level".
                                                    You can also adapt this approach to all aspects of your work – dividing each big task into more easily achievable pieces. For me, that proved essential.
                                                </p>
                                                <li><u>Reward yourself by meeting goals</u></li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Of course, a key aspect of dividing your work is rewarding yourself when you reach certain new "levels".
                                                    These rewards, while not truly intrinsic – essentially, they amount to a way to deceive one another – can be powerful.
                                                    For example, you might think "as soon as I can close this project, I'll reward myself with a trip", rather than just buy it right away. That can kick me to a higher march.
                                                    Again, that kind of motivation won't sustain you for long, but it does provide a little push.
